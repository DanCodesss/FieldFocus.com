				  <p>The Selecao would be foolish to pin their hopes on the former Paris Saint-Germain attacker, who has been reduced to a physical wreck

                    The sight of Neymar being carted off the pitch in tears during Brazil's 2-0 World Cup qualifying defeat against Uruguay was all too familiar. Al-Hilal subsequently confirmed that the 31-year-old had suffered a tear to the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in his knee, and pencilled him in for surgery.
                    
                    Neymar's operation was a success, but he still has a lengthy rehabilitation programme ahead of him. The experienced forward is not expected to return to Saudi Pro League action this season, and it has been suggested he is facing an uphill task to make Brazil's squad for the 2024 Copa America, which kicks-off on June 20.
                    
                    Paris Saint-Germain reportedly sold Neymar in the summer due to concerns over his physical condition. He scored 118 goals in 178 appearances for the club after his world-record €222 million (£194m/$237m) move from Barcelona in 2017, winning five Ligue 1 titles along the way - but also sat out over 100 games due to injury.
                   <br>
                   
                   <hr>
                   Despite that miserable fitness record, Fernando Diniz is adamant that Neymar still has a vital role to play for Brazil in the coming years. "We wish him a good recovery and that he comes back stronger," the interim Selecao boss told a press conference last week. "I believe that he has yet to write the most beautiful pages of his history. This injury has not erased this possibility, 
                   it may have made it more difficult, but he will be able to use it as a strength to come back stronger."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Neymar will be 34 by the time the next World Cup roles around in Canada, Mexico and the United States. That beautiful golden trophy is one of the few missing from his impressive CV, but Brazil won't have any chance of lifting their sixth global title if he is still in the starting XI by then.

                    Facilitating an environment for Neymar to prolong his international career would make sense if Brazil were short of attacking talent, but they just so happen to be blessed with unprecedented depth in that department. The former Barcelona superstar's full potential is destined to go unfulfilled, 
                    but there are plenty of others primed to succeed where he failed, and it's time for a ruthless decision to be made.
<br><br>

<br>

				 <br><br>
                 That is not to say that Neymar doesn't deserve respect for what he's achieved over the course of his career. He dazzled audiences with his dribbling skills after breaking into the Santos first-team as a teenager, and by the age of 21, had already earned a move to one of the world's biggest clubs.

                 At Barca, he formed one third of arguably the most fearsome attacking trio in history, alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Neymar wasn't quite able to match his team-mates in the goal stakes,
                  but his creativity and guile on the ball elevated them to greater heights, and he was unstoppable in full flow.
<br><br>

A haul of eight trophies in four years, including two La Liga titles and the Champions League, reflected just how special that Barca frontline was. And had Neymar stayed at Camp Nou, he may very well have gone on to pick up the Ballon d'Or.

His move to PSG wasn't a complete failure, but it did ultimately prevent him from reaching the pinnacle of the sport. Neymar put money and enhancing his profile away from the pitch ahead of his development as a player.
<br><br>
There will be no glorious final swansong for Neymar, either. Mismanagement when it comes to his recovery and physique has ensured that his best years are well and truly behind him.

Brazil might not be ready to let go, but holding on to an iconic figure who has clearly gone past his expiry date will derail their chances of becoming the best team in the world again. Neymar has given so much to his country, and boasts an incredible record of 79 goals from 128 at international level. 
He overtook Pele as the Selecao's all-time top scorer after netting a brace in a 5-1 win over Bolivia in September; that title alone means he should be remembered as a Brazilian legend.
<br><br>
World Cup and Copa America glory has been elusive for Neymar, but not through a lack of effort.
 He's got 13 goals and eight assists to his name from 25 outings at those major tournaments. Some of the memories from those performances will last a lifetime, too. His goal in Brazil's 2022 World Cup quarter-final against Croatia ranks among the best-ever scored on that stage, despite his team's eventual defeat on penalties.
<br><br>
Brazilian fans have been fortunate to witness Neymar produce so many moments of magic since his debut goal against the U.S. as an 18-year-old way back in 2010. And if he were to walk away, he would be celebrated.

Neymar has been a great servant - but he risks damaging a hard-earned legacy by continuing to make himself available for selection. The time has come for Neymar to retire from Brazil duty, so that a new era can begin for a squad that has greater potential for success than any he was previously a part of.

<br><br>
Brazil now have two superstars at the forefront of their next generation, both of whom have established themselves as household names at Real Madrid in recent years. Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo operate on the wings for the Selecao, and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

Vinicius joined Real from Flamengo in 2018, with Rodrygo following him to Santiago Bernabeu a year later, and they've since helped the Spanish giants win their 14th European Cup, two La Liga crowns, two FIFA Club World Cups and the Copa del Rey.
<br><br>
They built up an instant rapport and their partnership is growing stronger year on year, as evidenced by their stunning individual performances in Real's 5-1 victory over Valencia on November 11. Carlo Ancelotti heaped praise on the pair after seeing them each net a brace at the Bernabeu, silencing critics after a goal-shy start to the new season in the process.

"They needed time to get back to their best and show their quality," he said. "In the last two games, they've done very well. They combined well, looked for space and played with exceptional quality. You can say they are back."
<br><br>
In a Brazil shirt, Vinicius and Rodrygo have only scored seven goals between them to date, but with Neymar sidelined indefinitely, Diniz will be relying on the duo to increase their output significantly.

They will have to step up if Brazil are to bounce back from a shaky start to their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, especially with first-choice No.9 Gabriel Jesus also struggling for fitness. That shouldn't be a problem given how consistent both men have been for Madrid, 
who face more pressure to win every week than any other club in world football.
<hr>
It has also been reported that Vinicius and Rodrygo will also soon be working with Ancelotti at international level. CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues has claimed the Madrid boss will be replacing Diniz as Brazil manager when his contract at the Bernabeu expires at the end of the season, just in time to get the squad in shape for the Copa America.

Ancelotti certainly knows exactly how the get the best out of Vinicius and Rodrygo, who are destined to be the leading lights for Brazil through to the next World Cup in three years' time.
